## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants can solve them in any programming language. This repository contains my solutions for the 2023 Advent of Code challenges.

## How to Run

To run the code for a specific day and part, use the following command:
```sh 
cargo run -- <day>-<part>
```

For example, to run the solution for day 1, part a, use:
```sh 
cargo run -- 01-a
```
